I expect that people will find out how to use Chain of Thought reasoning to generate a new dataset to finetune the model on, and that by finetuning on this data the model will improve. This process can then be repeated, which one day might bring us a language model with superhuman intelligence. That model would be the closest humanity can hope to get to an oracle.\n",
